# Investec ML Reports

**Investec ML Reports** is a Python-based application that connects to the Investec Programmable Banking API, fetches all outgoing (DEBIT) transactions for a user, stores them in a local database, and uses machine learning (Prophet) to forecast future monthly spending. The project is built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Prophet, and is designed for easy deployment and extensibility.

---

## Features

- **Full Transaction Fetching:**
  Fetches all DEBIT transactions from an Investec account, handling pagination and date ranges to ensure complete history.

- **Data Storage:**
  Stores users and their transactions in a local SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. (Postgres will be used when final version is released)

- **Monthly Aggregation:**
  Aggregates transactions into monthly totals for analysis and forecasting.

- **Outlier Handling:**
  Detects and removes (or caps) outlier months to improve the accuracy of forecasts.

- **Machine Learning Forecast:**
  Uses Facebook Prophet to predict next monthâ€™s spending, providing a confidence interval and trend analysis.

- **REST API:**
  FastAPI endpoints for:
    - Creating users
    - Fetching and saving transactions
    - Generating spending forecasts
    - Deleting users and all their data

## Quickstart

Will update once production version is released.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /users/`
